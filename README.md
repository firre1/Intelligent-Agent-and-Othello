# Othello Agent with α-β Pruning Minimax

This is an Othello (Reversi) game built using an existing Java framework. (https://github.com/EudyContreras/Othello-FX)

I have extended the original project by implementing an **AI agent** that uses the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning**.

## What This Project Does

- Lets you play the game Othello
- Includes an intelligent agent that plays using the Minimax algorithm
- Uses Alpha-Beta pruning to improve performance and make smarter moves
- Allows single-player mode (human vs AI)
